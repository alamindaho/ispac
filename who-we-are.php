                            <h2 class="sub-head">Never Say;</h2>
                            <p class="history">1. I am too young: The average life expectancy in this country is 45 years
                                old. Why wasting your time waiting till you are older to make things
                                better? Let's join hands together to campaign and fight for the positive
                                change you want to see in this country now so that you too can enjoy.
                                After hearing that young people are the leaders of tomorrow over and
                                over, it is understandable that a lot of them may become firm believers in
                                the saying. More young people need to realize that they are not just
                                leaders of tomorrow, they have the potential to be leaders of today. <br>
                                2. I do not have any rich and powerful connections, so am yet in the position
                                to make change. <br>
                                3. Am not rich, what different can I make? <br>
                                4. As students as concerned, my parents want me to focus on my school
                                work. They said that I cannot save the world until I save myself. <br>
                                5. I do not know it I can actually make a difference. <br>
                                6. I do not know where to start. <br>
                                You have more time and energy than older people to influence the
                                positive change in your community. There are statistically and
                                approximately over 1.8-billion students and young people in the world. If
                                even a quarter of these people decided to positively change in, the world
                                would be unimaginable. By becoming a positive change agent early in
                                your life, you will have more time to enjoy the change you make in your
                                country. The time for you to stand up for a better change is now!
