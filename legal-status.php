                                in accordance with the provision of Part C. of the Nigerian Companies and
                                Allied Matters Act (C.A.M.A). The organization base on the provision of
                                Section (6) subsection (1) of the Federal Republic of Nigerian 1999
                                Constitution (as amended) stated that;
                                “The judicial powers of the Federation shall vested in the courts to which this
                                Section relates, being courts established for the federation”
                                It also incorporates and focuses on Section (18)subsection (1-3) alpha (a-c) in
                                the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) stated;
                                Subsection (1) Government shall direct its policy towards ensuring that there
                                are equal and adequate education opportunities at all levels. Subsection (2)
                                Government shall promote science and technology; Subsection (3)
                                Government shall strive to eradicate illiteracy; and this End government shall
                                as and when practicable provide; Alpha (a) Free, compulsory and universal
                                primary education; (b) Free University education; (c) Free adult literacy
                                programme.
                                Section (23) of the 1999 Federal Republic of Nigerian Constitution (as
                                amended) is not left behind but include as quoted “The national ethics shall be
                                Discipline, Integrity, Dignity of labour, Social justice, Religious tolerance, Selfreliance and Patriotism”.
                                I-SPAC INTERNATIONAL also relies on the provision of Section (40) of the
                                1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) provided
                                “Every person shall be entitle to assemble freely and associate with Other
                                persons, and in particular he may form or belong to any. Political Party, trade
                                union or any other association for the protection of his Interest”
                                But the section has a provision which state that; “Provided that the provision
                                of this section is not derogate from the Powers conferred by this constitution on
                                the Independent National Electoral Commission with respect to political parties
                                to which that commission does not accord recognition”.
