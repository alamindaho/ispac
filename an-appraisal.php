                            <p class="history">I-SPAC INTERNATIONAL advocate that the body serve as a watchdog for
                                students and youths in all Government Parastatal, Ministries, Financial and
                                Communication and Educational institutions for effective monitoring. Such
                                as; Students Exam Malpractice, Intimidation of Students by their superior
                                officers (Lecturers), Cultism, Drug abuse, Holding of Students Result, Sexual
                                harassment, and Union found embezzlement by student's Union leaders etc.
                                Yes, I-SPAC INTERNATIONAL is a welcome addition to the small but
                                growing critical needed informational and personal development resource
                                for students and youth development advocates, I have always believed my
                                responsibility in National Human Right Commission NHRC is to
                                incorporates and work hand to hand and give them roots and wings to fly, as
                                Nigeria faces daunting challenges. I-SPAC is the root and base line for
                                students (Human) development. Programme managers are interested in
                                actualizing the full potential of students and young people as assets and agents
                                for special transformation in Nigeria. Here, I declare to all students and
                                youths both at Home and Diaspora that whoever is interested in positive
                                change in their mini or larger environments despite bearing, as a group, a
                                hugely disproportionate burden of poverty, ill-health and other consequences
                                of the country's extended crises of economic underdevelopment and social
                                instability, should give 100% support to I-SPAC. It is also NHRC hope that
                                everyone with an interest in the present and future well-being of Nigeria and
                                the students should embrace and welcome I-SPAC!!! <br>
