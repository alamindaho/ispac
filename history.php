                            <p class="history">Human societies from time immemorial have been battling with
                                mismanagement of public resources stemming from moral decadence
                                which eventually led to embezzlement and corruption for selfaggrandizement. Countries all over the world, particularly developing
                                countries, Nigeria inclusive have in various fora formulating policies and
                                laws to punish the corrupt officials, but all efforts ended up in a total fiasco.
                                However, in order to salvage our country from the monstrosity of this cancer
                                known as corruption emerged the idea of forming this non- governmental
                                organization known as International Initiative for Students Push Against
                                Corruption (I-SPAC) in the year 2010 by a global visionary leader, a
                                patriotic mind-set and dedicated Nigerian Student and Youth Ambassador
                                known as “Amb. Yusuf Muhammad Abdulkadir”. A huge support and
                                contribution from another vibrant youths leader “Amb. Shatta Abayomi
                                Abdulbaqi” including the support of Amb. Ogochukwu Joel, Amb. Mansur
                                Muhammad Dalhatu, Amb. Aminu Abubakar and Amb. Al-Amin
                                Abdullahi Daho. The organization was conceived as student's vanguard
                                with umbrella body covering the entire nation and the globe at large, with
                                representative from all institutions within and from the four walls of the
                                globe. Its aim is to canvass plethora of opinions to champion the campaign
                                and fight against corruption which have been hampering development in
                                the country. I-SPAC INTERNATIONAL envisaged that corruption as one
                                single cankerworm that have eaten deep into the fabrics of society and have
                                immeasurably affected all sectors of governance and hindered development.
